- **Status:** End-of-life, superseded by v4 and v5
- **Breaking Changes in v5:**
  - Path behavior changed for single artifact downloads by ID
  - By name: extraction unchanged
  - By ID: now extracts directly to path (was nested before)
- **Recommendation:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **UPDATE TO v4.3.0** (safer, fewer breaking changes than v5)

### ‚ùå CRITICAL: softprops/action-gh-release
- **Current:** `@v1` (ancient)
- **Latest:** `v2.4.1` (January 7, 2025)
- **Status:** v1 is from ~2020, severely outdated

- **Recommendation:** ‚úÖ **UPDATE TO v2.4.1**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM: actions/checkout

- **Recommendation:** Consider `@v4.3.0` (stable, well-tested)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM: actions/setup-python
- **Current:** `@v4`
- **Latest:** `@v6.0.0` (September 4, 2024)
- **Status:** v5 is better choice than v6 for stability
- **Breaking Changes in v6:**
  - Requires runner v2.327.1 or newer
  - Upgraded to Node 24
- **Recommendation:** ‚úÖ **UPDATE TO v5.6.0** (LTS-like stability)

### ‚úÖ OK: GreenTF/upload-thunderstore-package
- **Current:** `@v4.3`
- **Latest:** `@v4.3` ‚úÖ ALREADY UP TO DATE

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: CRITICAL Updates (Do First)
1. Update `softprops/action-gh-release@v1` ‚Üí `@v2.4.1`
   - Files: `generate-and-release.yml`
   - Risk: Low (many releases since v1, well-tested)

2. Update `actions/upload-artifact@v3` ‚Üí `@v4.6.2`
   - Files: `generate-and-release.yml`
   - Risk: Medium (breaking changes, but our code doesn't use hidden files feature)
   - Action: Add `include-hidden-files: false` to be explicit

3. Update `actions/download-artifact@v3` ‚Üí `@v4.3.0`
   - Files: `generate-and-release.yml`
   - Risk: Medium (path behavior change, need to test)
   - Note: We don't use artifact-ids, so path behavior unchanged

### Phase 2: MEDIUM Priorities (Nice to Have)
4. Update `actions/setup-python@v4` ‚Üí `@v5.6.0`
   - Files: `ci.yml`, `generate-and-release.yml`
   - Risk: Low (backward compatible)

5. Update `actions/checkout@v4` ‚Üí `@v4.3.0`
   - Files: Multiple files
   - Risk: Very Low (patch version, backward compatible)

## Testing Strategy After Updates

1. **Create a test branch** from feature/cicd-automated-release
2. **Make version updates** one action at a time
3. **Run CI workflow** to validate each change
4. **Test full pipeline** with manual workflow dispatch
5. **Monitor** first automatic release for errors

## Questions to Resolve Before Updating

1. **Should we use major version tags or specific patch versions?**
   - Current: Major only (`@v4`)
   - Recommended: Use major with patch for stability (`@v4.6.2`)

2. **Can we run a test workflow to validate before merge?**
   - Suggest creating a test dispatch workflow

3. **Should we add artifact retention policy updates?**
   - v4 upload-artifact has new concurrency/timeout env vars

---

## Conclusion

**Action Required:** All three CRITICAL actions need updating. These should be done before next production release.

**Recommended Timeline:**
- ‚úÖ This week: Make critical updates
- ‚úÖ Next PR: Test updates thoroughly
- ‚úÖ Before next release: Deploy with updated actions
